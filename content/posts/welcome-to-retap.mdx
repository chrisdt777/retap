# Welcome to Retap

This is your first post on Retap. Retap is a minimal, static personal publishing platform designed for writers who want a clean, distraction-free space to share their ideas.

## What is Retap?

Retap is a **static-first** publishing platform built with:

- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **MDX** for content authoring

## Features

- Clean, minimal design
- Tag-based filtering
- Client-side search
- SEO optimized
- Dark mode support
- No backend, no database

## Writing in MDX

Posts are written in MDX, which means you can use:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists (like this one!)
- Code blocks

```
console.log('Hello, Retap!');
```

## Getting Started

To add a new post, create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/posts` directory with the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-01-15"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
featured: false
description: "A short description for SEO and previews"
---
```

Start writing your content below the frontmatter, and it will automatically appear on your site.

Happy writing!
