# Building for the Long Term

Quick wins are satisfying. But lasting impact comes from thinking long-term.

## The Architecture of Time

When we build software, we often optimize for:
- Fast shipping
- Immediate user feedback
- Quarterly metrics

These are important. But what about **5 years from now**?

## Timeless Principles

### 1. Simple Foundations

Complex systems built on simple foundations survive. Complex systems built on complex foundations collapse.

Choose boring technology. Standardize on proven patterns. Save innovation for where it matters.

### 2. Avoid Over-Abstraction

Premature abstraction is the root of much complexity.

> "The best code is no code. The second best code is very little code." — Jeff Atwood

Build what you need. Refactor when you see the pattern. Not before.

### 3. Document Decisions

Why did you choose this approach? In six months, you won't remember.

Write down your reasoning. Future you (and your team) will thank you.

## Measuring Success

Don't just measure:
- Lines of code
- Features shipped
- Bugs fixed

Measure:
- Systems that rarely break
- Features easy to understand
- Decisions easy to change

## The Long View

Build for the long term, and you'll find:

- Easier maintenance
- Faster feature development
- Happier teams
- Better user experiences

The best time to start thinking long-term was yesterday. The second best time is today.
